# linux-font-installer
This is a quick script that allows you to install fonts properly on Linux from URLs

Author of the script: https://dev.to/pulkitsingh

# How to use it
1. Create a new file: `font_installer.sh` with the code from the file above

2. Make sure you run `sudo chmod 777 font_installer.sh` so it is executable

3. Now you can run it using `./font_installer.sh https://your.url.com`

* You can try it with this command: `./install-font.sh https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1`

I saved this script here because I've had problems with installing fonts, and Hack seems like the best one that also has icon in NVIM

Hope you found it useful, and make sure you check the author of the script: https://dev.to/pulkitsingh
